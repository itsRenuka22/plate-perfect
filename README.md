# PLATE PERFECT - Automatic Recognition of Non-Standard Number Plates using Yolov8 - image + video support

## Description

Detection of Number Plate using the robust and state-of-art Yolov8 model, latest in the Yolo series which is trained specially on the Indian Lisence Plates. Recognition is facilitated by the Google Vision API that offers multi-lingual support enabling accurate identification of the non-standard text that is illegaly included on the Lisence Plates. Additionally, a Flask API has been integrated offering scalability.

      pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Create following empty folders**

      ```bash
      check2
      distinct_ocr
      uploads
      ```

4. **Change paths**
